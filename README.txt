Portfolio - version 1

A portfolio created to store all of my achievements and work within. Launched under "danefroelicher.com"

I will continue to use this portfolio, and build off of the pre-existing code when I want to make changes or add something new. 

This current version of my portfolio includes:
- Recent Work & Full Resume
- Highlighted projects 
- Prominent courses taken at the University of Louisville
- Social links to my Github, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook
